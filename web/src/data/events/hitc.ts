Participants can &apos;think outside the box&apos; or from diverse perspectives by participating in quiz tournaments.The participants will be students who just graduated +2 from various colleges. The theme for the questions will be DSA and OOP.The objectives of conducting a technical quiz related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are multi-fold. Firstly, the quiz aims to assess participants' knowledge and understanding of fundamental concepts in DSA and OOP, including data structures, algorithms, and OOP principles. The quiz challenges participants to apply their knowledge to solve problems effectively, testing their problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and ability to analyze and design solutions. Moreover, the quiz promotes continuous learning and improvement by identifying areas where participants may need further study or practice. It also serves as valuable preparation for technical interviews and coding competitions, familiarizing participants with common question types and enhancing their problem-solving abilities",
