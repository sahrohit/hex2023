          <h1>Why a Code of Conduct?</h1>
          <p>
            We, the developer community of Nepal, are committed to nurturing an
            inclusive and safe environment for hackathons and our community as a
            whole. It is our responsibility to create spaces where individuals
            who face discrimination, harassment, or intimidation can feel
            protected and welcomed. We believe that hackathons have the power to
            not only drive technological progress but also shape our culture.
            Therefore, this Code of Conduct serves as a testament to our ongoing
            efforts to address these issues and reinforce our commitment to
            finding solutions.
          </p>
          <h1>Applicability</h1>
          <p>

            form of harassment towards our participants. In the context of
            workshops, presentations, or online platforms associated with
