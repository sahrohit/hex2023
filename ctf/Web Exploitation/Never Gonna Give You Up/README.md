  <summary>Solution</summary>

The major issue here is you cannot open the page in the browser.

Openning the webpage in a REST Client like, POSTMAN, Hopscotch.io, you'll be able to see that the contents of `1.html` and see that it redirects to `2.html`.

Now fetch the `2.html` using the REST Client, and you'll have you flag.
