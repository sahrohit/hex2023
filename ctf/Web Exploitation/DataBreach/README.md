# Data Breach

Your team has been tipped by one of the rebels of a weak vulnerability in HEx' mainframe
database. Pretending to be HEx', crack the password, and breach into its mainframe where
classified information is stored. Be careful though, as HExâ€™ robots are always on high alert
and they keep changing the password.

  <summary>Solution</summary>

Check `robots.txt` for all the hidden paths that you can open.

You can see `records.html` there, this contains a list of possible passwords. The `index.html` has the function used for encrypting the password.

Collect the each part of encrypted passwords from `script.js`, `style.css` and `3outof3.html`.

After combining the password, hash the passwords in `record.html` and compare it to the hashed password. You'll have your password.

As instructed, you have to enter pretending to be HEX, use username `hex` with the password to login.
