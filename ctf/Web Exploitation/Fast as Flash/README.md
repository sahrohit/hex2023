URGENT HEx-Team,

One of the prisoners in the space prison has hacked into the Hexagon educational website and we suspect they have left a message for us. We need your assistance in locating it.

Best of luck,

Someone had to add code to cause the flash on the screen. I wish we could stop this code from executing.

  <summary>Solution</summary>
 When the website is first loaded, it can be seen that there is a flag that quickly changes to the omni flags logo after less than a second. Reloading this page will show the flash of the flag again but it is not fully readable. In order to keep the flag on the screen to make it readable, you need to:

Inspect the page
Navigate to the sources tab and open the javascript file
Create a breakpoint in this javascript file
Reload the page and the flag will stay on the screen.
