Check inside `https://hexrobots.vercel.app/robots.txt`, and you'll see three files,

```
User-agent: *

Disallow: /26022003.html
Disallow: /10122003.html
Disallow: /18112002.html
```

You can see, these three urls are specified not to lookup by bots. But still there are three options, open each of the files with `https://hexrobots.vercel.app/<htmlfile>.html` and get the flag. Beaware of the ⚠️fake flag.
